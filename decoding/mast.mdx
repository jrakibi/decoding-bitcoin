In Bitcoin, as scripts become more complex, they face limitations in size, cost, and privacy. **Merkelized Abstract Syntax Trees (MAST)** offer a solution by enabling more efficient and private smart contracts.

## What is MAST?

Merkelized Abstract Syntax Trees (MAST) organize Bitcoin's spending conditions into a **Merkle tree**. Instead of revealing all script conditions on-chain, only the Merkle root is stored. This makes the process more efficient and private, revealing only the executed condition.

### Key Benefits:

-   **Efficiency**: Only the Merkle root is on-chain, saving space and reducing costs.
-   **Privacy**: Unused conditions stay hidden, increasing privacy.
-   **Scalability**: Allows more complex scripts while avoiding size and opcode limitations.

## How MAST Works

1. Each spending condition is hashed individually.
2. The hashes are combined into a Merkle tree, producing a Merkle root.
3. The Merkle root is stored in the transaction output.
4. To spend, the user provides the relevant script, data, and a Merkle proof linking the script to the root.

## Conclusion

MAST significantly improves Bitcoinâ€™s ability to handle complex transactions by reducing on-chain data and enhancing privacy. Its integration into **Taproot** (BIP 341) is a key milestone in Bitcoin's evolution, ensuring more efficient, scalable, and private smart contracts.
