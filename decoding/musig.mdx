By the end of this article, we want Alice, Bob, and Carol to sign a transaction using MuSig.

We will explain step by step using both theory and code. Your task by the end is to write the code for this signature generation.

## 1. Theory

To make this article simple to follow, we will answer three important questions that will help you understand the concept: **What? Why? How?**

### What is MuSig?

MuSig is simply a protocol for aggregating public keys and signatures.

### Why do we need MuSig?

The reasons we use MuSig are:

-   **Transaction Size/Fees:** MuSig makes multi-sig look like single-sig. This means you pay the same fees whether one person or ten people sign.

-   **Privacy:** Nobody can tell if a transaction used multiple signers or just one. Your multi-sig setup stays private, as it looks identical to a regular transaction.

### How does MuSig work?

Now we need your focus here, please. Grab a coffee, and let's dive in.

Alice, Bob, and Carol want to create an aggregated signature such as:  
**s_agg = s_a + s_b + s_c**

To create this signature, we need to go through three main steps:

1. Aggregating public keys.
2. Aggregating nonces.
3. Aggregating the signature.

Some of these steps require rounds of communication between participants:

-   Aggregating public keys does **not** require communication.
-   Aggregating nonces and signatures requires **three rounds of communication** (MuSig2 optimizes this to **two rounds**).

---

## Step 1: Public Key Aggregation (Offline Process)

A naive way to do public key aggregation is by summing up each participant's public key:

**P_agg = P_a + P_b + P_c**

However, this approach is vulnerable to a **key cancellation attack.**

---

### What is a key cancellation attack?

Imagine a scenario where Alice and Bob want to create a 2-of-2 aggregated signature. To achieve this, they need to:

1. Exchange public keys.
2. Exchange nonce commitments (needed for Schnorr signatures).

But if Bob knows Alice’s public key (P_a) and nonce (R_a) beforehand, Bob can deceive Alice by sending modified values to her:

-   **P'\_b = P_b - P_a**
-   **R'\_b = R_b - R_a**

When Alice calculates the signature, this manipulation causes issues.

---

### Let’s break it down:

The aggregated Schnorr signature equation is:  
**s_agg = s_a + s_b'**

Expanding it:

**s*agg * G = (R*a + h * P_a) + (R'\_b + h \* P'\_b)**  
**= R_a + R'\_b + h(P_a + P'\_b)**  
**= R_a + (R_b - R_a) + h(P_a + P_b - P_a)**  
**= R_b + h(P_b)**  
**= s_b \* G**

---

**Did you catch it?**  
Bob can now sign the transaction alone without Alice's cooperation: **s_agg = s_b**

---

### How do we counteract the key cancellation attack?

To counteract this, we add a **challenge factor** to each participant's public key:

**P'\_i = c_i \* P_i**  
(_c_i = challenge factor_)

The challenge factor is generated based on the participants' aggregated public key.

This ensures that no individual participant can create a public key that offsets the public keys of others.

Here’s how we construct individual public keys and the aggregated public key:  
(_Remember, all of this happens offline. There’s no need for communication; public keys can be exchanged through offline channels._)

[Insert illustration here.]

---

### Exercise 1: Compute 3-of-3 MuSig public key

In this exercise, we'll use the `generate_musig_key(pubkey_list)` function to generate challenge factors for each participant and an aggregate MuSig pubkey.

`generate_musig_key(pubkey_list)` takes a list of the participants' public keys `generate_musig_key([ECPubKey0, ECPubKey1, ...])` and returns a challenge map and the aggregate pubkey:

-   The challenge map contains `ECPubKey_i, challenge_data_i` key - value pairs.
-   The aggregate pubkey is an `ECPubKey` object.

Now, let’s move to the next step: **Aggregate Nonce**.


## Step 2: Aggregate Nonce (1st and 2nd Round of Communication)

The process of aggregating nonces is as follows:

1. Alice, Bob, and Carol each generate a random nonce **k_A**, **k_B**, and **k_C**.
2. They calculate their respective nonce points:
   **R_A = k_A * G**, **R_B = k_B * G**, **R_C = k_C * G**.
3. They exchange these nonce points (**R_A**, **R_B**, and **R_C**).
4. Finally, they calculate the aggregated nonce:
   **R_agg = R_A + R_B + R_C**

---

### Where do the rounds of communication happen in this process?

Great question! The process of aggregating nonces is somewhat similar to aggregating public keys.

**Except**: Public keys (e.g., **P_A**, **P_B**, and **P_C**) stay the same for every signature process, but random numbers (**k_A**, **k_B**, **k_C**) must change with every signature.

Thus, in each signature process, we need a round of communication where Alice, Bob, and Carol exchange their **R_i** values to construct:
**R_agg = R_A + R_B + R_C**

However, before this step (where they exchange **R_i**), there is a **prior round of communication** to ensure none of them cheats by changing their **R_i** after seeing the others’ values.

---

### How do we prevent cheating?

To prevent cheating, Alice, Bob, and Carol must first exchange the **hashes** of their nonce points (e.g., **H(R_A)**, **H(R_B)**, **H(R_C)**) before revealing their actual **R_i** values. This ensures that once they reveal their **R_i**, they cannot modify their values after seeing others’.

---

### Summary: Two Rounds of Communication for Nonce Aggregation

1. **Exchange hash commitments:**
   Alice, Bob, and Carol share **H(R_A)**, **H(R_B)**, and **H(R_C)**.

2. **Exchange nonce points:**
   They reveal **R_A**, **R_B**, and **R_C**.

Once all **R_i** values are shared, they compute the aggregated nonce:
**R_agg = R_A + R_B + R_C**

---

### Exercise 2: Compute 3-of-3 MuSig nonce

In this exercise, we'll generate nonces for individual participants, calculate the nonce point commitments, and then generate an aggregate nonce point.

## Step 3: Signature Aggregation (Final Step)

After computing the **aggregate public key** (`P_agg`) and **aggregate nonce** (`R_agg`), each participant calculates their **partial signature**:

`s_i = k_i + H(x(R_agg) | P_agg | m) * d_i`

Where:

-   `k_i`: Participant's random nonce.
-   `d_i`: Participant's private key.
-   `H`: Hash function with `R_agg`, `P_agg`, and the message `m`.

---

### Aggregating the Signatures

Participants exchange their `s_i` values, and the **aggregate signature** is computed as:

`s_agg = s_A + s_B + s_C`

This simplifies to:

`s_agg = k_agg + H(x(R_agg) | P_agg | m) * d_agg`

Where:

-   `k_agg = k_A + k_B + k_C` (aggregate nonce scalar).
-   `d_agg = d_A + d_B + d_C` (aggregate private key scalar).

---

### Final Signature

The final aggregate signature is:

`(R_agg, s_agg)`

This pair can be verified using `P_agg` and the message `m`.

---

### Exercise 3: Compute aggregated MuSig signature

In this exercise, we'll generate nonces for individual participants, calculate the nonce point commitments, and then generate an aggregate nonce point.
